This is the WIP source code for popd.site

The website itself isn't public but feel free to use any of the source code here.

If you plan to use anything from this project, note that I'm using this project to learn HTML and CSS so it's likely that there are way better ways to design this site.

I would like to mention that this site is meant to be hosted locally or something like nginx or apache if you plan on using it. Some styles might not work on github pages.
